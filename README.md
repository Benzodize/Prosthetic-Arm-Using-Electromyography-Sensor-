# Prosthetic-Arm-Using-Electromyography-Sensor-
A low-cost prosthetic arm controlled by muscle signals using EMG sensors.The system uses a microcontroller to read EMG data and control servo motors for basic hand movements like gripping and releasing. Ideal for learning about bio-signals and assistive tech.

## Key points on Develpoing it Further.
- 1. Objective / Purpose
To design and build a prosthetic arm that responds to muscle signals (EMG) from the human body.

Helps amputees or people with limb disabilities control an artificial limb intuitively.

- 2. Core Components
EMG Sensors (e.g., MyoWare, ADS1299, or surface electrodes): Detect electrical signals from muscle activity.

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, STM32, Raspberry Pi Pico): Processes EMG signals and controls actuators.

Actuators / Motors (Servo or DC motors): Provide mechanical movement to the arm's joints.

Power Supply: Battery pack or power adapter to run the system.

Mechanical Arm Structure: Made from plastic, aluminum, or 3D-printed materials for flexibility and strength.

- 3. Signal Acquisition & Processing
EMG sensors detect voltage changes during muscle contraction.

Signals are filtered, amplified, and normalized to reduce noise.

Use of signal processing algorithms or machine learning models (optional) to classify gestures.

- 4. Control System
Use microcontroller to map specific EMG signal patterns to hand gestures or movements.

Control logic: When a particular muscle contracts, the corresponding motor performs a movement (e.g., hand closing).

PWM signals control servo angles for smooth movement.

- 5. Design Considerations
Comfort and fit for the user.

Responsiveness and accuracy of movements.

Safety: Ensure the motors do not exert excessive force.

Power efficiency for longer usage.

Durability and ease of maintenance.

- 6. Challenges
EMG signals are noisy and variable between users.

Sensor placement is critical for accurate readings.

Needs fine-tuning and calibration for each user.

Latency and real-time processing constraints.

- 7. Testing & Calibration
Use test subjects to record EMG patterns.

Validate movements: open/close hand, wrist rotation, etc.

Recalibrate sensor thresholds as needed.

- 8. Applications
Assistive devices for amputees.

Robotic rehabilitation.

Human-machine interaction research.

Biofeedback systems.

- 9. Future Improvements
Use of wireless EMG systems.

Machine learning for gesture classification.

Integration with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

3D-printed customized prosthetics for better fit
